# Motor Trend Car Road Tests data
# The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine,
# and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance
# for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

# mpg - Miles/(US) gallon
# cyl - Number of cylinders
# disp - Displacement (cu.in.)
# hp - Gross horsepower
# drat - Rear axle ratio
# wt - Weight (1000 lbs)
# qsec - 1/4 mile time
# vs - Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
# am - Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
# gear - Number of forward gears
# carb - Number of carburetors
